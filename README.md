--insert screenshots here--

A fork of AIDungeon2.


#### Features:
------------------------

* Complete rewrite of the user interface
 * Color text output
 * Console Bell when AI finishes
 * Much improved prompt selection
 * Ability to save custom prompts
* A much larger library of fan made starting prompts
* Better config file
* Eventually hope to improve the AI itself, but this will take some time

#### Installation Instructions:
------------------------

--insert colab instructions/guide here--

To play the game locally, it is recommended that you have an nVidia GPU with 12 GB or more of memory, and CUDA installed. If you do not have such a GPU, each turn can take about a minute.

Windows Installer is hopefully coming soon. In the meantime you can manually install pretty easily:

Install python (version 3.7 or lower), tensorflow (1.14 or possibly 1.15 are known to work) and numpy then:
```
git clone "https://github.com/cloveranon/Clover-Edition/"
cd aidungeon
python3 play.py
```
