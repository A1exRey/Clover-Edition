#Temperature controls how random the AI's output is.
#	Close to 0 means it always produces the most likely word.
#		Usually short and boring responses, easily getting stuck in loops.
#	1 makes it as "statistically unpredictable" as real text.
#		The AI isn't perfect at predicting humans, so results in very random behavior
#	Lots of folk wisdom is being spread about the best choice.
#		Claims that somewhere between 0.1-0.3 or even lower is optimal for coomers.
#			Ok coomers.
#The number of words the AI has to choose from.
#	It always chooses the "top k" most likely next words before randomly picking one according to temperature.
#	Low values reduce the randomness of the AI similar to temp.
#	Claims it might affect performance if too high, seems unlikely.
#literally no idea what this does or if it should even be enabled
#probably related to the number of words the AI produces at a time? Possibly affects performance.
#dings the console bell when the AI responds
#	check your terminal emulator's support for console bells if this doesn't work, it should typically buzz the PC speaker
#	betcha didn't know ASCII supported sound
#Maximum width of lines
#	set to 0 to disable
#	Text wrapping has been much requested since I disabled it from vanilla.
#		In principle this should be a function of your terminal emulator and not an issue
#		Not sure of a good default but 80 was considered an ideal standard number of columns in old PCs.
#Tensorflow log level
#	seems to give informative messages about what options your CPU and tensorflow install supports. Not sure what a good default should be.
#ECMA-48 set graphics codes
#Check out "man console_codes"
#	Several attributes can be set in the same sequence, separated by semicolons.  An empty parameter  (between  semicolons  or  string initiator or terminator) is interpreted as a zero.
#0       reset all attributes to their defaults
